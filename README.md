# Video Demo of DeepFTSG-2

DeepFTSG-2 results on CDnet-2014, SBI-2015, and LASIESTA datasets, where SBI-2015 and LASIESTA are completely unseen datasets that are used for generalization purposes. The red color states missed detection (false negative), the blue color states over detection (false positive), the white color states correct foreground detection (true positive), the black color states correct background detection (true negative), the gray color states don't care regions, and dark-gray color states out of Region of Interest (ROI).
