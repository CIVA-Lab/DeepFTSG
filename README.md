# Video Demo of DeepFTSG-2

DeepFTSG-2 results on CDnet-2014, SBI-2015, and LASIESTA datasets, where SBI-2015 and LASIESTA are completely unseen datasets that are used for generalization purposes. The red color states missed detection (false negative) and the blue color states over detection (false positive).
